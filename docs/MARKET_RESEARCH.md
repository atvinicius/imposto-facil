# Market Research: Brazilian Tax Reform (EC 132/2023)

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Market Size

- **6.4 million businesses** in Brazil affected by the reform
- **4.6 million small businesses** registered in 2025 (77% MEI, 19% ME, 4% EPP)
- **72% of mid/large companies** are NOT prepared to adapt (V360 survey, Nov 2025)
- **33%** haven't even started discussing impacts internally
- 7-year transition window (2026–2033) = long runway for solutions

## Implementation Timeline

| Year | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **2026** | Pilot/test phase. CBS 0.9% + IBS 0.1% on invoices (informational). No penalties for 3 months after regulation. Simples Nacional exempt. |
| **2027** | CBS enters full effect. Simples Nacional starts highlighting IBS/CBS. Tax benefits end abruptly. Companies need double control systems. |
| **2027–2032** | Gradual replacement of ICMS, ISS, PIS, COFINS, IPI. Old and new systems coexist. |
| **2033** | Full implementation. Old taxes completely replaced by IBS, CBS, IS (Selective Tax). |

## Key Pain Points for Businesses

1. **Confusion/fear** — most SME owners don't understand what's changing
2. **System adaptation** — ERP/POS must connect to government calculator
3. **Invoice risk** — companies that can't adapt may be unable to issue invoices
4. **Double tax system** — 2026-2032 requires managing both old and new simultaneously
5. **Credit management** — planning accumulated PIS/COFINS/ICMS/IPI/ISS credits
6. **Contract renegotiation** — companies depending on tax benefits must act before 2027
7. **Cost of professional advice** — accountants are overwhelmed, consultations are expensive

## Gaps and Opportunities

### 1. Personalized AI Assistant (Primary Opportunity)

**What exists**: Generic government chatbot (BotRTC), basic V360 assistant
**What's missing**: AI that understands your specific business (sector, state, size, regime) and gives tailored guidance
**Why it matters**: Every business is affected differently. Generic advice isn't actionable.

### 2. Actionable Guidance (Not Just Education)

**What exists**: Educational content (what changed), calculators (how much)
**What's missing**: "What should I do next?" — prioritized action plans, deadline trackers, checklists
**Why it matters**: 72% unprepared businesses need hand-holding, not more theory

### 3. SME-Focused End-to-End Solution

**What exists**: Enterprise tools (TOTVS), generic simulators, accounting platforms
**What's missing**: Complete journey for SMEs: assess → learn → plan → act
**Why it matters**: 99% of Brazilian businesses are micro/small. Most can't afford TOTVS or dedicated consultants.

### 4. Affordable Access to Guidance

**What exists**: Free generic content OR expensive professional consulting
**What's missing**: Middle ground — personalized, affordable, always-available guidance
**Why it matters**: SME owners need help but can't justify R$200+/hour consultations for every question

## Strategic Direction Chosen

**Path A: Reform Readiness Tool for SMEs**

- Target: Small business owners (MEI, ME, EPP) who are confused and scared about the reform
- Positioning: Free/affordable tool that makes the complex reform understandable and actionable for YOUR specific business
- Differentiator: Personalized AI + impact simulation + structured knowledge — all in one place, in simple language
- Monetization: Freemium (generous free tier, paid for advanced features)
- Not competing with: TOTVS (enterprise), accountants (professional advice), Receita Federal (official/institutional)
- Competing on: Accessibility, personalization, simplicity, actionability
